Bot created to ping users in Discord when the streamer goes live.

Requirements: 
    mysql server
    nginx
    Twitch Python (pip install twitch-python)
    Discord Python (pip install discord.py)
    Python dotenv (pip install python-dotenv)
    Tornado (pip install tornado)
    Requests (pip install requests)

Discord bot permission requirements:
    Manage Roles
    View Channels
    Send Messages

Usage:
    Requires developer keys for both Twitch and Discord. Those should be entered into a .env file (create with `cp .env.example .env`). Add the bot to the Discord server. It will also register with Twitch webhooks to receive notifications when the streamer goes live. If so, it will ping the role.
    

Note that if you leave the role ID blank, the bot will create a new role (called Goobers) and log the role ID. This ID should then be (manually) entered into the .env file to allow the bot to use the same role on future startups.

Also note that you will likely need to set up port forwarding for the port specified in your .env file.
